# OpenAI SourceForge

Drop in any question ‚Üí this app intelligently classifies whether it's technical or research-oriented,  
then scrapes the most relevant sources using stealth browsers via **[Hyperbrowser](https://hyperbrowser.ai)**.  
For research/medical questions, it prioritizes **Google Scholar** and **PubMed**. For technical questions,  
it focuses on documentation and developer resources. All results are processed by **GPT-4o** to generate  
comprehensive answers with **clickable citations** and **academic source verification**.

## üîë Get started

1. **Get your API Keys**:
   - [Hyperbrowser API Key](https://hyperbrowser.ai) 
   - [OpenAI API Key](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)

2. Clone this repo and set up environment:

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd openai-source-forge
cp .env.example .env
```

3. Add your API keys to `.env`:
```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
HYPERBROWSER_API_KEY=your_hyperbrowser_api_key_here
```

4. Install and run:
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## üîß How it Works

1. **Classify**: AI classifies your question as technical, research, or medical using GPT-4o-mini
2. **Smart Search**: 
   - **Research/Medical**: Prioritizes Google Scholar, PubMed, and academic databases
   - **Technical**: Focuses on documentation, GitHub, Stack Overflow, and developer resources
3. **Scrape**: Uses Hyperbrowser SDK to navigate and extract content from targeted sources
4. **Verify**: Validates all sources to ensure no hallucinated citations
5. **Analyze**: Captures all API endpoints made during page loads
6. **Generate**: Sends scraped content to GPT-4o for intelligent analysis with proper citations
7. **Package**: Creates downloadable bundles with answers, clickable citations, and API data
